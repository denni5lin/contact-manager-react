# Contact Manager (React)

This is a single-page application using React featuring an app that manages a collection of my contacts. All my contacts stored on this app were pulled from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

## Launch the project

- Clone this repository by typing `git clone https://github.com/denni5lin/contact-manager-react.git` into your command line. Or [Download](https://github.com/denni5lin/contact-manager-react/archive/master.zip) this repository.
- Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- Start the development server with `npm start` (this will automatically launch your default browser and open application)
